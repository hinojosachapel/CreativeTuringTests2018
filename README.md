# APOLLO: A  *Pie Forzado* Automatic Poetry Composer

In the frame of the [Creative Turing Tests 2018](http://bregman.dartmouth.edu/turingtests) contest, organized by the Dartmouth Collegeâ€™s Neukom Institute for Computational Science, I submitted to the LyriX challenge an AI generative system able to create poems from a phrase. This repo holds the project's source code. For more info, you may read the text submitted as the [project description](/ApolloReadme.pdf).

Apollo is a Language Modeling system based on n-grams and Markov Chains. The modeling logic, training and generation, are encapsulated in a POCO C# class, it does not have any dependency on any external framework. For simplicity in the distribution of the executable file, the project was developed as a WPF solution, so **you will need Visual Studio on Windows** for executing it.
