LXXIX

   Where his vast neck just mingles with the spine,
   Sheathed in his form the deadly weapon lies.
   He stops he starts disdaining to decline:
   Slowly he falls, amidst triumphant cries,
   Without a groan, without a struggle dies.
   The decorated car appears on high:
   The corse is piled sweet sight for vulgar eyes;
   Four steeds that spurn the rein, as swift as shy,
Hurl the dark bull along, scarce seen in dashing by.
