LXXXV

   Adieu, fair Cadiz! yea, a long adieu!
   Who may forget how well thy walls have stood?
   When all were changing, thou alone wert true,
   First to be free, and last to be subdued.
   And if amidst a scene, a shock so rude,
   Some native blood was seen thy streets to dye,
   A traitor only fell beneath the feud:
   Here all were noble, save nobility;
None hugged a conqueror's chain save fallen Chivalry!
