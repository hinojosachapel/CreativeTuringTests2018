XCII

   Oh, known the earliest, and esteemed the most!
   Dear to a heart where nought was left so dear!
   Though to my hopeless days for ever lost,
   In dreams deny me not to see thee here!
   And Morn in secret shall renew the tear
   Of Consciousness awaking to her woes,
   And Fancy hover o'er thy bloodless bier,
   Till my frail frame return to whence it rose,
And mourned and mourner lie united in repose.
