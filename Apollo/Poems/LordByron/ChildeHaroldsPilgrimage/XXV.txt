XXV

   Convention is the dwarfish demon styled
   That foiled the knights in Marialva's dome:
   Of brains (if brains they had) he them beguiled,
   And turned a nation's shallow joy to gloom.
   Here Folly dashed to earth the victor's plume,
   And Policy regained what Arms had lost:
   For chiefs like ours in vain may laurels bloom!
   Woe to the conquering, not the conquered host,
Since baffled Triumph droops on Lusitania's coast.
