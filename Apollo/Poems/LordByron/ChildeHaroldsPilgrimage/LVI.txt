LVI

   Her lover sinks she sheds no ill-timed tear;
   Her chief is slain she fills his fatal post;
   Her fellows flee she checks their base career;
   The foe retires she heads the sallying host:
   Who can appease like her a lover's ghost?
   Who can avenge so well a leader's fall?
   What maid retrieve when man's flushed hope is lost?
   Who hang so fiercely on the flying Gaul,
Foiled by a woman's hand, before a battered wall?
