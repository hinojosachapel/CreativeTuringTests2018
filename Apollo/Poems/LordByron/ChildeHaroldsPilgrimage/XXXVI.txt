XXXVI

   Teems not each ditty with the glorious tale?
   Ah! such, alas, the hero's amplest fate!
   When granite moulders and when records fail,
   A peasant's plaint prolongs his dubious date.
   Pride! bend thine eye from heaven to thine estate,
   See how the mighty shrink into a song!
   Can volume, pillar, pile, preserve thee great?
   Or must thou trust Tradition's simple tongue,
When Flattery sleeps with thee, and History does thee wrong?
