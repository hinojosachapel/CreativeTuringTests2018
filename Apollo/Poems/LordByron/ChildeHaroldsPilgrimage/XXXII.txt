XXXII

   Where Lusitania and her Sister meet,
   Deem ye what bounds the rival realms divide?
   Or e'er the jealous queens of nations greet,
   Doth Tayo interpose his mighty tide?
   Or dark sierras rise in craggy pride?
   Or fence of art, like China's vasty wall? 
   Ne barrier wall, ne river deep and wide,
   Ne horrid crags, nor mountains dark and tall
Rise like the rocks that part Hispania's land from Gaul
