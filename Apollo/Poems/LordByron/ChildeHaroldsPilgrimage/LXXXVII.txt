LXXXVII

   Ye, who would more of Spain and Spaniards know,
   Go, read whate'er is writ of bloodiest strife:
   Whate'er keen Vengeance urged on foreign foe
   Can act, is acting there against man's life:
   From flashing scimitar to secret knife,
   War mouldeth there each weapon to his need 
   So may he guard the sister and the wife,
   So may he make each curst oppressor bleed,
So may such foes deserve the most remorseless deed!
