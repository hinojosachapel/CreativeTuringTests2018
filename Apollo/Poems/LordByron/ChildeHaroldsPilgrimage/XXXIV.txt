   But ere the mingling bounds have far been passed,
   Dark Guadiana rolls his power along
   In sullen billows, murmuring and vast,
   So noted ancient roundelays among.
   Whilome upon his banks did legions throng
   Of Moor and Knight, in mailed splendour drest;
   Here ceased the swift their race, here sunk the strong;
   The Paynim turban and the Christian crest
Mixed on the bleeding stream, by floating hosts oppressed.
