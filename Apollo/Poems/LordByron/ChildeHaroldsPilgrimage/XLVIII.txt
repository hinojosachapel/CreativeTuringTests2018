XLVIII

   How carols now the lusty muleteer?
   Of love, romance, devotion is his lay,
   As whilome he was wont the leagues to cheer,
   His quick bells wildly jingling on the way?
   No! as he speeds, he chants 'Viva el Rey!'
   And checks his song to execrate Godoy,
   The royal wittol Charles, and curse the day
   When first Spain's queen beheld the black-eyed boy,
And gore-faced Treason sprung from her adulterate joy.
