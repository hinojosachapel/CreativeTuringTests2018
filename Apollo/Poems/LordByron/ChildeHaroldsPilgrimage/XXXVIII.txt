XXXVIII

   Hark! heard you not those hoofs of dreadful note?
   Sounds not the clang of conflict on the heath?
   Saw ye not whom the reeking sabre smote;
   Nor saved your brethren ere they sank beneath
   Tyrants and tyrants' slaves? the fires of death,
   The bale-fires flash on high: from rock to rock
   Each volley tells that thousands cease to breathe:
   Death rides upon the sulphury Siroc,
Red Battle stamps his foot, and nations feel the shock.
