   Behold the hall where chiefs were late convened!
   Oh! dome displeasing unto British eye!
   With diadem hight foolscap, lo! a fiend,
   A little fiend that scoffs incessantly,
   There sits in parchment robe arrayed, and by
   His side is hung a seal and sable scroll,
   Where blazoned glare names known to chivalry,
   And sundry signatures adorn the roll,
Whereat the urchin points, and laughs with all his soul.
