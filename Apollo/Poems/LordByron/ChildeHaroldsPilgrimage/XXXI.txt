XXXI

   More bleak to view the hills at length recede,
   And, less luxuriant, smoother vales extend:
   Immense horizon-bounded plains succeed!
   Far as the eye discerns, withouten end,
   Spain's realms appear, whereon her shepherds tend
   Flocks, whose rich fleece right well the trader knows 
   Now must the pastor's arm his lambs defend:
   For Spain is compassed by unyielding foes,
And all must shield their all, or share Subjection's woes.
