LVIII

   The seal Love's dimpling finger hath impressed
   Denotes how soft that chin which bears his touch:
   Her lips, whose kisses pout to leave their nest,
   Bid man be valiant ere he merit such:
   Her glance, how wildly beautiful! how much
   Hath Phoebus wooed in vain to spoil her cheek
   Which glows yet smoother from his amorous clutch!
   Who round the North for paler dames would seek?
How poor their forms appear? how languid, wan, and weak!
