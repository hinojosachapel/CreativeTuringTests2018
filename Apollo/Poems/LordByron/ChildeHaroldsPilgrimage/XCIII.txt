XCIII

   Here is one fytte of Harold's pilgrimage.
   Ye who of him may further seek to know,
   Shall find some tidings in a future page,
   If he that rhymeth now may scribble moe.
   Is this too much?  Stern critic, say not so:
   Patience! and ye shall hear what he beheld
   In other lands, where he was doomed to go:
   Lands that contain the monuments of eld,
Ere Greece and Grecian arts by barbarous hands were quelled.
