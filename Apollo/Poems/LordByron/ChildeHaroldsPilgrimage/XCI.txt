   And thou, my friend! since unavailing woe
   Bursts from my heart, and mingles with the strain 
   Had the sword laid thee with the mighty low,
   Pride might forbid e'en Friendship to complain:
   But thus unlaurelled to descend in vain,
   By all forgotten, save the lonely breast,
   And mix unbleeding with the boasted slain,
   While glory crowns so many a meaner crest!
What hadst thou done, to sink so peacefully to rest?
