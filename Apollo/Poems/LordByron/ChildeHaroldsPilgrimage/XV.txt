   Oh, Christ! it is a goodly sight to see
   What Heaven hath done for this delicious land!
   What fruits of fragrance blush on every tree!
   What goodly prospects o'er the hills expand!
   But man would mar them with an impious hand:
   And when the Almighty lifts his fiercest scourge
   Against those who most transgress his high command,
   With treble vengeance will his hot shafts urge
Gaul's locust host, and earth from fellest foemen purge.
