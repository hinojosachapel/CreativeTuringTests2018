LXIII

   Of thee hereafter. Even amidst my strain
   I turned aside to pay my homage here;
   Forgot the land, the sons, the maids of Spain;
   Her fate, to every free-born bosom dear;
   And hailed thee, not perchance without a tear.
   Now to my theme but from thy holy haunt
   Let me some remnant, some memorial bear;
   Yield me one leaf of Daphne's deathless plant,
Nor let thy votary's hope be deemed an idle vaunt.
