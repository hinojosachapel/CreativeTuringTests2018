I COULD SUFFICE FOR HIM, I KNEW 

I could suffice for Him, I knew-
He-could suffice for Me-
Yet Hesitating Fractions-Both
Surveyed Infinity-

"Would I be Whole" He sudden broached-
My syllable rebelled-
It was face to face with Nature-forced-
It was face to face with God-

Withdrew the Sun-to Other Wests-
Withdrew the furthest Star
Before Decision-stooped to speech-
And then-be audibler

The Answer of the Sea unto
The Motion of the Moon-
Herself adjust Her Tides-unto-
Could I-do else-with Mine?
