MADAM AND HER MADAM

I worked for a woman,
She wasn't mean-
But she had a twelve-room
House to clean.

Had to get breakfast,
Dinner, and supper, too-
Then take care of her children
When I got through.

Wash, iron, and scrub,
Walk the dog around-
It was too much,
Nearly broke me down.

I said, Madam,
Can it be
You trying to make a
Pack-horse out of me?

She opened her mouth.
She cried, Oh, no!
You know, Alberta,
I love you so!

I said, Madam,
That may be true-
But I'll be dogged
If I love you!
