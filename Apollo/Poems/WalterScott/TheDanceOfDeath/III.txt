III.

Lone on the outskirts of the host,
The weary sentinel held post,
And heard, through darkness far aloof,
The frequent clang of courser's hoof,
Where held the cloaked patrol their course,
And spurred 'gainst storm the swerving horse;
But there are sounds in Allan's ear,
Patrol nor sentinel may hear,
And sights before his eye aghast
Invisible to them have passed,
  When down the destined plain,
Between Britain and the bands of France,
Wild as marsh-borne meteor's glance,
Strange phantoms wheeled a revel dance,
  And doomed the future slain. -
Such forms were seen, such sounds were heard,
When Scotland's James his march prepared
  For Flodden's fatal plain;
Such, when he drew his ruthless sword,
As Choosers of the Slain, adored
  The yet unchristened Dane.
An indistinct and phantom band,
They wheeled their ring-dance hand in hand,
  With gestures wild and dread;
The Seer, who watched them ride the storm,
Saw through their faint and shadowy form
  The lightning's flash more red;
And still their ghastly roundelay
Was of the coming battle-fray,
  And of the destined dead.
