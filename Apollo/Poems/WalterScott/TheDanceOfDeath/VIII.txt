VIII.

At morn, grey Allan's mates with awe
Heard of the visioned sights he saw,
  The legend heard him say;
But the Seer's gifted eye was dim,
Deafened his ear, and stark his limb,
  Ere closed that bloody day.
He sleeps far from his Highland heath,
But often of the Dance of Death
  His comrades tell the tale
On picquet-post, when ebbs the night,
And waning watch-fires glow less bright,
  And dawn is glimmering pale.
