IV. SONG.

Wheel the wild dance
While lightnings glance,
  And thunders rattle loud,
And call the brave
To bloody grave,
  To sleep without a shroud.

Our airy feet,
So light and fleet,
  They do not bend the rye
That sinks its head when whirlwinds rave,
And swells again in eddying wave,
  As each wild gust blows by;
But still the corn,
At dawn of morn,
  Our fatal steps that bore,
At eve lies waste,
A trampled paste
  Of blackening mud and gore.
Wheel the wild dance
While lightnings glance,
  And thunders rattle loud,
And call the brave
To bloody grave,
  To sleep without a shroud.
