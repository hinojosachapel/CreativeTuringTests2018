III.

Fear not the heat, though full and high
The sun has scorched the autumn sky,
And scarce a forest straggler now
To shade us spreads a greenwood bough;
These fields have seen a hotter day
Than e'er was fired by sunny ray,
Yet one mile on--yon shattered hedge
Crests the soft hill whose long smooth ridge
  Looks on the field below,
And sinks so gently on the dale
That not the folds of Beauty's veil
  In easier curves can flow.
Brief space from thence, the ground again
Ascending slowly from the plain
  Forms an opposing screen,
Which, with its crest of upland ground,
Shuts the horizon all around.
  The softened vale between
Slopes smooth and fair for courser's tread;
Not the most timid maid need dread
To give her snow-white palfrey head
  On that wide stubble-ground;
Nor wood, nor tree, nor bush are there,
Her course to intercept or scare,
  Nor fosse nor fence are found,
Save where, from out her shattered bowers,
Rise Hougomont's dismantled towers.
