XVIII.

Yet, even in yon sequestered spot,
May worthier conquest be thy lot
  Than yet thy life has known;
Conquest, unbought by blood or harm,
That needs nor foreign aid nor arm,
  A triumph all thine own.
Such waits thee when thou shalt control
Those passions wild, that stubborn soul,
  That marred thy prosperous scene:-
Hear this--from no unmoved heart,
Which sighs, comparing what THOU ART
  With what thou MIGHT'ST HAVE BEEN!
