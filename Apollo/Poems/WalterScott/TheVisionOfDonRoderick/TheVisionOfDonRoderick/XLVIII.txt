XLVIII.

  Proudly they march--but, oh! they march not forth
    By one hot field to crown a brief campaign,
  As when their Eagles, sweeping through the North,
    Destroyed at every stoop an ancient reign!
  Far other fate had Heaven decreed for Spain;
    In vain the steel, in vain the torch was plied,
  New Patriot armies started from the slain,
    High blazed the war, and long, and far, and wide,
And oft the God of Battles blest the righteous side.
