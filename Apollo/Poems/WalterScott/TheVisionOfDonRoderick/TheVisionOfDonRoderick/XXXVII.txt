  Even so, upon that peaceful scene was poured,
    Like gathering clouds, full many a foreign band,
  And HE, their Leader, wore in sheath his sword,
    And offered peaceful front and open hand,
  Veiling the perjured treachery he planned,
    By friendship's zeal and honour's specious guise,
  Until he won the passes of the land;
    Then burst were honour's oath and friendship's ties!
He clutched his vulture grasp, and called fair Spain his prize.
