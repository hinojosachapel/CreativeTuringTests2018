  Even while they read, the sand-glass wastes away;
    And, as the last and lagging grains did creep,
  That right-hand Giant 'gan his club upsway,
    As one that startles from a heavy sleep.

    At once descended with the force of thunder,
  And hurtling down at once, in crumbled heap,
    The marble boundary was rent asunder,
And gave to Roderick's view new sights of fear and wonder.
