LIX.

  And, oh! loved warriors of the Minstrel's land!
    Yonder your bonnets nod, your tartans wave!
  The rugged form may mark the mountain band,
    And harsher features, and a mien more grave;
  But ne'er in battlefield throbbed heart so brave
    As that which beats beneath the Scottish plaid;
  And when the pibroch bids the battle rave,
    And level for the charge your arms are laid,
Where lives the desperate foe that for such onset stayed!
