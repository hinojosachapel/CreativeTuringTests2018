LVIII.

  A various host--from kindred realms they came,
    Brethren in arms, but rivals in renown -
  For yon fair bands shall merry England claim,
    And with their deeds of valour deck her crown.
  Hers their bold port, and hers their martial frown,
    And hers their scorn of death in freedom's cause,
  Their eyes of azure, and their locks of brown,
    And the blunt speech that bursts without a pause,
And free-born thoughts which league the Soldier with the Laws.
