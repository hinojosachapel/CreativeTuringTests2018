XXXVIII.

  An iron crown his anxious forehead bore;
    And well such diadem his heart became,
  Who ne'er his purpose for remorse gave o'er,
    Or checked his course for piety or shame;
  Who, trained a soldier, deemed a soldier's fame
    Might flourish in the wreath of battles won,
  Though neither truth nor honour decked his name;
    Who, placed by fortune on a Monarch's throne,
Recked not of Monarch's faith, or Mercy's kingly tone.
