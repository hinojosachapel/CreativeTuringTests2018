  How fares Don Roderick?--E'en as one who spies
    Flames dart their glare o'er midnight's sable woof,
  And hears around his children's piercing cries,
    And sees the pale assistants stand aloof;
  While cruel Conscience brings him bitter proof,
    His folly, or his crime, have caused his grief;
  And while above him nods the crumbling roof,
    He curses earth and Heaven--himself in chief -
Desperate of earthly aid, despairing Heaven's relief!
