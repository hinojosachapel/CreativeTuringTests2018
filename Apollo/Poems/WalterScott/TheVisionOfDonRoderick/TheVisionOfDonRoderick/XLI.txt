  No longer now she spurned at mean revenge,
    Or stayed her hand for conquered foeman's moan;
  As when, the fates of aged Rome to change,
    By Caesar's side she crossed the Rubicon.
  Nor joyed she to bestow the spoils she won,
    As when the banded powers of Greece were tasked
  To war beneath the Youth of Macedon:
    No seemly veil her modern minion asked,
He saw her hideous face, and loved the fiend unmasked.
