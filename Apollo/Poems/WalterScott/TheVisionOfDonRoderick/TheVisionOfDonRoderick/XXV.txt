XXV.

  That scythe-armed Giant turned his fatal glass
    And twilight on the landscape closed her wings;
  Far to Asturian hills the war-sounds pass,
    And in their stead rebeck or timbrel rings;
  And to the sound the bell-decked dancer springs,
    Bazars resound as when their marts are met,
  In tourney light the Moor his jerrid flings,
    And on the land as evening seemed to set,
The Imaum's chant was heard from mosque or minaret.
