LVII.

  A various host they came--whose ranks display
    Each mode in which the warrior meets the fight,
  The deep battalion locks its firm array,
    And meditates his aim the marksman light;
  Far glance the light of sabres flashing bright
    Where mounted squadrons shake the echoing mead,
  Lacks not artillery breathing flame and night,
    Nor the fleet ordnance whirled by rapid steed,
That rivals lightning's flash in ruin and in speed.
