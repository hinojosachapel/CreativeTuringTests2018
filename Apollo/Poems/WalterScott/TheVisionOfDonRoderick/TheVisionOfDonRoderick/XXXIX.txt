XXXIX.

  From a rude isle his ruder lineage came,
    The spark, that, from a suburb-hovel's hearth
  Ascending, wraps some capital in flame,
    Hath not a meaner or more sordid birth.
  And for the soul that bade him waste the earth -
    The sable land-flood from some swamp obscure
  That poisons the glad husband-field with dearth,
    And by destruction bids its fame endure,
Hath not a source more sullen, stagnant, and impure.
