XII.

  "Prelate! a Monarch's fate brooks no delay;
    Lead on!"--The ponderous key the old man took,
  And held the winking lamp, and led the way,
    By winding stair, dark aisle, and secret nook,
  Then on an ancient gateway bent his look;
    And, as the key the desperate King essayed,
  Low muttered thunders the Cathedral shook,
    And twice he stopped, and twice new effort made,
Till the huge bolts rolled back, and the loud hinges brayed.
