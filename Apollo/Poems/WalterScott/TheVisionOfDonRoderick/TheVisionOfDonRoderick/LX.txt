  Hark! from yon stately ranks what laughter rings,
    Mingling wild mirth with war's stern minstrelsy,
  His jest while each blithe comrade round him flings,
    And moves to death with military glee:
  Boast, Erin, boast them! tameless, frank, and free,
    In kindness warm, and fierce in danger known,
  Rough Nature's children, humorous as she:
    And HE, yon Chieftain--strike the proudest tone
Of thy bold harp, green Isle!--the Hero is thine own.
