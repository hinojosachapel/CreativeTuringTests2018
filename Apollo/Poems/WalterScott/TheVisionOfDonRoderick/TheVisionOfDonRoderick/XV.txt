  Fixed was the right-hand Giant's brazen look
    Upon his brother's glass of shifting sand,
  As if its ebb he measured by a book,
    Whose iron volume loaded his huge hand;
  In which was wrote of many a fallen land
    Of empires lost, and kings to exile driven:
  And o'er that pair their names in scroll expand -
    "Lo, DESTINY and TIME! to whom by Heaven
The guidance of the earth is for a season given." -
