  "They come! they come! I see the groaning lands
    White with the turbans of each Arab horde;
  Swart Zaarah joins her misbelieving bands,
    Alla and Mahomet their battle-word,
  The choice they yield, the Koran or the Sword -
    See how the Christians rush to arms amain! -
  In yonder shout the voice of conflict roared,
    The shadowy hosts are closing on the plain -
Now, God and Saint Iago strike, for the good cause of Spain!
