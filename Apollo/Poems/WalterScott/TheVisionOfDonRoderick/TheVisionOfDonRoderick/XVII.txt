  For they might spy, beyond that mighty breach,
    Realms as of Spain in visioned prospect laid,
  Castles and towers, in due proportion each,
    As by some skilful artist's hand portrayed:
  Here, crossed by many a wild Sierra's shade,
    And boundless plains that tire the traveller's eye;
  There, rich with vineyard and with olive glade,
    Or deep-embrowned by forests huge and high,
Or washed by mighty streams, that slowly murmured by.
