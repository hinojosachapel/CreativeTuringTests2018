XXXIV.

  And well such strains the opening scene became;
    For VALOUR had relaxed his ardent look,
  And at a lady's feet, like lion tame,
    Lay stretched, full loath the weight of arms to brook;
  And softened BIGOTRY, upon his book,
    Pattered a task of little good or ill:
  But the blithe peasant plied his pruning-hook,
    Whistled the muleteer o'er vale and hill,
And rung from village-green the merry seguidille.
