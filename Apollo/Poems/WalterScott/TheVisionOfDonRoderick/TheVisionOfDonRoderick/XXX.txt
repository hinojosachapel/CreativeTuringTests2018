XXX.

  And thus it chanced that VALOUR, peerless knight,
    Who ne'er to King or Kaiser vailed his crest,
  Victorious still in bull-feast or in fight,
    Since first his limbs with mail he did invest,
  Stooped ever to that Anchoret's behest;
    Nor reasoned of the right, nor of the wrong,
  But at his bidding laid the lance in rest,
    And wrought fell deeds the troubled world along,
For he was fierce as brave, and pitiless as strong.
