II.

  All save the rushing swell of Teio's tide,
    Or, distant heard, a courser's neigh or tramp;
  Their changing rounds as watchful horsemen ride,
    To guard the limits of King Roderick's camp.
  For through the river's night-fog rolling damp
    Was many a proud pavilion dimly seen,
  Which glimmered back, against the moon's fair lamp,
    Tissues of silk and silver twisted sheen,
And standards proudly pitched, and warders armed between.
