XXVII.

  From the dim landscape rolled the clouds away -
    The Christians have regained their heritage;
  Before the Cross has waned the Crescent's ray,
    And many a monastery decks the stage,
  And lofty church, and low-browed hermitage.
    The land obeys a Hermit and a Knight, -
  The Genii those of Spain for many an age;
    This clad in sackcloth, that in armour bright,
And that was VALOUR named, this BIGOTRY was hight.
