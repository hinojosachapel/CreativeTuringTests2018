XLIV.

  But on the Natives of that Land misused,
    Not long the silence of amazement hung,
  Nor brooked they long their friendly faith abused;
    For, with a common shriek, the general tongue
  Exclaimed, "To arms!"--and fast to arms they sprung.
    And VALOUR woke, that Genius of the Land!
  Pleasure, and ease, and sloth aside he flung,
    As burst the awakening Nazarite his band,
When 'gainst his treacherous foes he clenched his dreadful hand.
