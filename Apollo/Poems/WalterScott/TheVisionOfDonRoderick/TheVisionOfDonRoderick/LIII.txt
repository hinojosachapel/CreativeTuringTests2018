LIII.

  Nor thine alone such wreck.  Gerona fair!
    Faithful to death thy heroes shall be sung,
  Manning the towers, while o'er their heads the air
    Swart as the smoke from raging furnace hung;
  Now thicker darkening where the mine was sprung,
    Now briefly lightened by the cannon's flare,
  Now arched with fire-sparks as the bomb was flung,
    And reddening now with conflagration's glare,
While by the fatal light the foes for storm prepare.
