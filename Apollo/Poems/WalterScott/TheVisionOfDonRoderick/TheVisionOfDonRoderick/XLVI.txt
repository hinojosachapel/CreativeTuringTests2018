XLVI.

  From Alpuhara's peak that bugle rung,
    And it was echoed from Corunna's wall;
  Stately Seville responsive war-shot flung,
    Grenada caught it in her Moorish hall;
  Galicia bade her children fight or fall,
    Wild Biscay shook his mountain-coronet,
  Valencia roused her at the battle-call,
    And, foremost still where Valour's sons are met,
First started to his gun each fiery Miquelet.
