XXIII.

  Then rose the grated Harem, to enclose
    The loveliest maidens of the Christian line;
  Then, menials, to their misbelieving foes,
    Castile's young nobles held forbidden wine;
  Then, too, the holy Cross, salvation's sign,
    By impious hands was from the altar thrown,
  And the deep aisles of the polluted shrine
  Echoed, for holy hymn and organ-tone,
The Santon's frantic dance, the Fakir's gibbering moan.
