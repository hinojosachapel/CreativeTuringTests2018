  And here, as erst upon the antique stage
    Passed forth the band of masquers trimly led,
  In various forms, and various equipage,
    While fitting strains the hearer's fancy fed;
  So, to sad Roderick's eye in order spread,
    Successive pageants filled that mystic scene,
  Showing the fate of battles ere they bled,
    And issue of events that had not been;
And, ever and anon, strange sounds were heard between.
