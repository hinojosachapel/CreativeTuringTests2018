XL.

  Before that Leader strode a shadowy Form;
    Her limbs like mist, her torch like meteor showed,
  With which she beckoned him through fight and storm,
    And all he crushed that crossed his desperate road,
  Nor thought, nor feared, nor looked on what he trode.
    Realms could not glut his pride, blood could not slake,
  So oft as e'er she shook her torch abroad -
    It was AMBITION bade her terrors wake,
Nor deigned she, as of yore, a milder form to take.
