XXXV.

  Grey Royalty, grown impotent of toil,
    Let the grave sceptre slip his lazy hold;
  And, careless, saw his rule become the spoil
    Of a loose Female and her minion bold.
  But peace was on the cottage and the fold,
    From Court intrigue, from bickering faction far;
  Beneath the chestnut-tree Love's tale was told,
    And to the tinkling of the light guitar,
Sweet stooped the western sun, sweet rose the evening star.
