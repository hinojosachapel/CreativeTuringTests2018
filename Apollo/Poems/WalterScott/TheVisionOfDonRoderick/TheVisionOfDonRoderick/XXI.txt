  "By Heaven, the Moors prevail! the Christians yield!
    Their coward leader gives for flight the sign!
  The sceptred craven mounts to quit the field -
    Is not yon steed Orelio?--Yes, it is mine!
  But never was she turned from battle-line:
    Lo! where the recreant spurs o'er stock and stone! -
  Curses pursue the slave, and wrath divine!
    Rivers ingulph him!"--"Hush," in shuddering tone,
The Prelate said; "rash Prince, yon visioned form's thine own."
