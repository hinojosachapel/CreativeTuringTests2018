  Oft his proud galleys sought some new-found world,
    That latest sees the sun, or first the morn;
  Still at that Wizard's feet their spoils he hurled, -
    Ingots of ore from rich Potosi borne,
  Crowns by Caciques, aigrettes by Omrahs worn,
    Wrought of rare gems, but broken, rent, and foul;
  Idols of gold from heathen temples torn,
    Bedabbled all with blood.--With grisly scowl
The Hermit marked the stains, and smiled beneath his cowl.
