  What minstrel verse may sing, or tongue may tell,
    Amid the visioned strife from sea to sea,
  How oft the Patriot banners rose or fell,
    Still honoured in defeat as victory!
  For that sad pageant of events to be
    Showed every form of fight by field and flood;
  Slaughter and Ruin, shouting forth their glee,
    Beheld, while riding on the tempest scud,
The waters choked with slain, the earth bedrenched with blood!
