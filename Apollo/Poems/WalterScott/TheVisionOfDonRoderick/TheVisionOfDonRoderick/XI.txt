XI.

  "Ill-fated Prince! recall the desperate word,
    Or pause ere yet the omen thou obey!
  Bethink, yon spell-bound portal would afford
    Never to former Monarch entrance-way;
  Nor shall it ever ope, old records say,
    Save to a King, the last of all his line,
  What time his empire totters to decay,
    And treason digs, beneath, her fatal mine,
And, high above, impends avenging wrath divine." -
