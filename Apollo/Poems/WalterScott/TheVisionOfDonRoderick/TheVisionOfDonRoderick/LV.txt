  Don Roderick turned him as the shout grew loud -
    A varied scene the changeful vision showed,
  For, where the ocean mingled with the cloud,
    A gallant navy stemmed the billows broad.
  From mast and stern St. George's symbol flowed,
    Blent with the silver cross to Scotland dear;
  Mottling the sea their landward barges rowed,
    And flashed the sun on bayonet, brand, and spear,
And the wild beach returned the seamen's jovial cheer.
