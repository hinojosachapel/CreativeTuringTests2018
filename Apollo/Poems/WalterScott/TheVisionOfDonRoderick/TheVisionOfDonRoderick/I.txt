I.

  Rearing their crests amid the cloudless skies,
    And darkly clustering in the pale moonlight,
  Toledo's holy towers and spires arise,
    As from a trembling lake of silver white.
  Their mingled shadows intercept the sight
    Of the broad burial-ground outstretched below,
  And nought disturbs the silence of the night;
    All sleeps in sullen shade, or silver glow,
All save the heavy swell of Teio's ceaseless flow.
