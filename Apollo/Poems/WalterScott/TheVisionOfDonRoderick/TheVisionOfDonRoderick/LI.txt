  Then Zaragoza--blighted be the tongue
    That names thy name without the honour due!
  For never hath the harp of Minstrel rung,
    Of faith so felly proved, so firmly true!
  Mine, sap, and bomb thy shattered ruins knew,
    Each art of war's extremity had room,
  Twice from thy half-sacked streets the foe withdrew,
    And when at length stern fate decreed thy doom,
They won not Zaragoza, but her children's bloody tomb.
