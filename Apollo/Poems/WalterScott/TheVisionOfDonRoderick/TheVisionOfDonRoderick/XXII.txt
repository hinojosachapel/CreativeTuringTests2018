  Just then, a torrent crossed the flier's course;
    The dangerous ford the Kingly Likeness tried;
  But the deep eddies whelmed both man and horse,
    Swept like benighted peasant down the tide;
  And the proud Moslemah spread far and wide,
    As numerous as their native locust band;
  Berber and Ismael's sons the spoils divide,
    With naked scimitars mete out the land,
And for the bondsmen base the free-born natives brand.
