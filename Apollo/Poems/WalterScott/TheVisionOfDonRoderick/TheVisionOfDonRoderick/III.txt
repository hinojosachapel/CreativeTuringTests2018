III.

  But of their Monarch's person keeping ward,
    Since last the deep-mouthed bell of vespers tolled,
  The chosen soldiers of the royal guard
    The post beneath the proud Cathedral hold:
  A band unlike their Gothic sires of old,
    Who, for the cap of steel and iron mace,
  Bear slender darts, and casques bedecked with gold,
    While silver-studded belts their shoulders grace,
Where ivory quivers ring in the broad falchion's place.
