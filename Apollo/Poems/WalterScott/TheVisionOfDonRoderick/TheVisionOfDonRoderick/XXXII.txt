    Tribute to Heaven of gratitude and praise;
  And at his word the choral hymns awake,
    And many a hand the silver censer sways,

    Mix steams from corpses smouldering in the fire;
  The groans of prisoned victims mar the lays,
    And shrieks of agony confound the quire;
While, 'mid the mingled sounds, the darkened scenes expire.
