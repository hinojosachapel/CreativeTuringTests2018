XXIX.

  Haughty of heart and brow the Warrior came,
    In look and language proud as proud might be,
  Vaunting his lordship, lineage, fights, and fame:
    Yet was that barefoot Monk more proud than he:
  And as the ivy climbs the tallest tree,
    So round the loftiest soul his toils he wound,
  And with his spells subdued the fierce and free,
    Till ermined Age and Youth in arms renowned,
Honouring his scourge and haircloth, meekly kissed the ground.
