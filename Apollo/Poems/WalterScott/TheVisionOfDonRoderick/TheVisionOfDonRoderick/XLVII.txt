XLVII.

  But unappalled, and burning for the fight,
    The Invaders march, of victory secure;
  Skilful their force to sever or unite,
    And trained alike to vanquish or endure.
  Nor skilful less, cheap conquest to ensure,
    Discord to breathe, and jealousy to sow,
  To quell by boasting, and by bribes to lure;
    While nought against them bring the unpractised foe,
Save hearts for Freedom's cause, and hands for Freedom's blow.
