XLIX.

  Nor unatoned, where Freedom's foes prevail,
    Remained their savage waste.  With blade and brand
  By day the Invaders ravaged hill and dale,
    But, with the darkness, the Guerilla band
  Came like night's tempest, and avenged the land,
    And claimed for blood the retribution due,
  Probed the hard heart, and lopped the murd'rous hand;
    And Dawn, when o'er the scene her beams she threw
'Midst ruins they had made, the spoilers' corpses knew.
