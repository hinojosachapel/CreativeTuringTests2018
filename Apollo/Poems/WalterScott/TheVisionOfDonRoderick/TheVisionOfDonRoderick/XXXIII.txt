XXXIII.

  Preluding light, were strains of music heard,
    As once again revolved that measured sand;
  Such sounds as when, for silvan dance prepared,
    Gay Xeres summons forth her vintage band;
  When for the light bolero ready stand
    The mozo blithe, with gay muchacha met,
  He conscious of his broidered cap and band,
    She of her netted locks and light corsette,
Each tiptoe perched to spring, and shake the castanet.
