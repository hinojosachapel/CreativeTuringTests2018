LIV.

  While all around was danger, strife, and fear,
    While the earth shook, and darkened was the sky,
  And wide Destruction stunned the listening ear,
    Appalled the heart, and stupefied the eye, -
  Afar was heard that thrice-repeated cry,
    In which old Albion's heart and tongue unite,
  Whene'er her soul is up, and pulse beats high,
    Whether it hail the wine-cup or the fight,
And bid each arm be strong, or bid each heart be light.
