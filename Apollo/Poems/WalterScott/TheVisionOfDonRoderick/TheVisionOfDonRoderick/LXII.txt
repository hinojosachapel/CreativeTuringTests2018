LXII.

  Or may I give adventurous Fancy scope,
    And stretch a bold hand to the awful veil
  That hides futurity from anxious hope,
    Bidding beyond it scenes of glory hail,
  And painting Europe rousing at the tale
    Of Spain's invaders from her confines hurled,
  While kindling nations buckle on their mail,
    And Fame, with clarion-blast and wings unfurled,
To Freedom and Revenge awakes an injured World!
