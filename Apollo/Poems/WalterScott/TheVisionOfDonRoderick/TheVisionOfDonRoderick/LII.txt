LII.

  Yet raise thy head, sad city!  Though in chains,
    Enthralled thou canst not be!  Arise, and claim
  Reverence from every heart where Freedom reigns,
    For what thou worshippest!--thy sainted dame,
  She of the Column, honoured be her name
    By all, whate'er their creed, who honour love!
  And like the sacred relics of the flame,
    That gave some martyr to the blessed above,
To every loyal heart may thy sad embers prove!
