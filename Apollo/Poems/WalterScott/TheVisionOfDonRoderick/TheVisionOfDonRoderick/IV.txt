IV.

  In the light language of an idle court,
    They murmured at their master's long delay,
  And held his lengthened orisons in sport:-
    "What! will Don Roderick here till morning stay,
  To wear in shrift and prayer the night away?
    And are his hours in such dull penance past,
  For fair Florinda's plundered charms to pay?"
    Then to the east their weary eyes they cast,
And wished the lingering dawn would glimmer forth at last.
