LVI.

  It was a dread, yet spirit-stirring sight!
    The billows foamed beneath a thousand oars,
  Fast as they land the red-cross ranks unite,
    Legions on legions bright'ning all the shores.
  Then banners rise, and cannon-signal roars,
    Then peals the warlike thunder of the drum,
  Thrills the loud fife, the trumpet-flourish pours,
    And patriot hopes awake, and doubts are dumb,
For, bold in Freedom's cause, the bands of Ocean come!
