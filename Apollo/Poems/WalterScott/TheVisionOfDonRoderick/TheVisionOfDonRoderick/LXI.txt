LXI.

  Now on the scene Vimeira should be shown,
    On Talavera's fight should Roderick gaze,
  And hear Corunna wail her battle won,
    And see Busaco's crest with lightning blaze:-
  But shall fond fable mix with heroes' praise?
    Hath Fiction's stage for Truth's long triumphs room?
  And dare her wild flowers mingle with the bays
    That claim a long eternity to bloom
Around the warrior's crest, and o'er the warrior's tomb!
