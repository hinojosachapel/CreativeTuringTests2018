XLII.

  That Prelate marked his march--On banners blazed
    With battles won in many a distant land,
  On eagle-standards and on arms he gazed;
    "And hopest thou, then," he said, "thy power shall stand?
  Oh! thou hast builded on the shifting sand,
    And thou hast tempered it with slaughter's flood;
  And know, fell scourge in the Almighty's hand,
    Gore-moistened trees shall perish in the bud,
And by a bloody death shall die the Man of Blood!"
