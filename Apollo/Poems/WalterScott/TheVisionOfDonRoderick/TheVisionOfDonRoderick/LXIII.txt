LXIII.

  O vain, though anxious, is the glance I cast,
    Since Fate has marked futurity her own:
  Yet Fate resigns to worth the glorious past,
    The deeds recorded, and the laurels won.
  Then, though the Vault of Destiny be gone,
    King, Prelate, all the phantasms of my brain,
  Melted away like mist-wreaths in the sun,
    Yet grant for faith, for valour, and for Spain,
One note of pride and fire, a Patriot's parting strain!
