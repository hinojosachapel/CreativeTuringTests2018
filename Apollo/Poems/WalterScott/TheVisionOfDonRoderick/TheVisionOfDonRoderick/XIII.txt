  Long, large, and lofty was that vaulted hall;
    Roof, walls, and floor were all of marble stone,
  Of polished marble, black as funeral pall,
    Carved o'er with signs and characters unknown.
  A paly light, as of the dawning, shone
    Through the sad bounds, but whence they could not spy;
  For window to the upper air was none;
    Yet, by that light, Don Roderick could descry
Wonders that ne'er till then were seen by mortal eye.
