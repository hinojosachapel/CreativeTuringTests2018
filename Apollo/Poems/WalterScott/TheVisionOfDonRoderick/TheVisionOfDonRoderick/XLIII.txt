XLIII.

  The ruthless Leader beckoned from his train
    A wan fraternal Shade, and bade him kneel,
  And paled his temples with the crown of Spain,
    While trumpets rang, and heralds cried "Castile!"
  Not that he loved him--No!--In no man's weal,
    Scarce in his own, e'er joyed that sullen heart;
  Yet round that throne he bade his warriors wheel,
    That the poor puppet might perform his part,
And be a sceptred slave, at his stern beck to start.
