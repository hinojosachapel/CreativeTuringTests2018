XLV.

  That Mimic Monarch now cast anxious eye
    Upon the Satraps that begirt him round,
  Now doffed his royal robe in act to fly,
    And from his brow the diadem unbound.
  So oft, so near, the Patriot bugle wound,
    From Tarik's walls to Bilboa's mountains blown,
  These martial satellites hard labour found
    To guard awhile his substituted throne -
Light recking of his cause, but battling for their own.
