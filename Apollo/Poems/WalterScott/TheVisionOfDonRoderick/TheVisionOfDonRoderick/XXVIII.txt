XXVIII.

  VALOUR was harnessed like a chief of old,
    Armed at all points, and prompt for knightly gest;
  His sword was tempered in the Ebro cold,
    Morena's eagle plume adorned his crest,
  The spoils of Afric's lion bound his breast.
    Fierce he stepped forward and flung down his gage;
  As if of mortal kind to brave the best.
    Him followed his Companion, dark and sage,
As he, my Master, sung the dangerous Archimage.
