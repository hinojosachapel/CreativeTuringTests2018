VI.

  Full on the Prelate's face, and silver hair,
    The stream of failing light was feebly rolled:
  But Roderick's visage, though his head was bare,
    Was shadowed by his hand and mantle's fold.
  While of his hidden soul the sins he told,
    Proud Alaric's descendant could not brook,
  That mortal man his bearing should behold,
    Or boast that he had seen, when Conscience shook,
Fear tame a monarch's brow, Remorse a warrior's look.
