  But, far within, Toledo's Prelate lent
    An ear of fearful wonder to the King;
  The silver lamp a fitful lustre sent,
    So long that sad confession witnessing:
  For Roderick told of many a hidden thing,
    Such as are lothly uttered to the air,
  When Fear, Remorse, and Shame the bosom wring,
    And Guilt his secret burden cannot bear,
And Conscience seeks in speech a respite from Despair.
