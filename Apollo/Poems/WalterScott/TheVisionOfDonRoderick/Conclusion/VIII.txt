VIII.

  But thou--unfoughten wilt thou yield to Fate,
    Minion of Fortune, now miscalled in vain!
  Can vantage-ground no confidence create,
    Marcella's pass, nor Guarda's mountain-chain?
  Vainglorious fugitive! yet turn again!
    Behold, where, named by some prophetic Seer,
  Flows Honour's Fountain, {2} as foredoomed the stain
    From thy dishonoured name and arms to clear -
Fallen Child of Fortune, turn, redeem her favour here!
