  Nor be his praise o'erpast who strove to hide
    Beneath the warrior's vest affection's wound,
  Whose wish Heaven for his country's weal denied;
    Danger and fate he sought, but glory found.
  From clime to clime, where'er war's trumpets sound,
    The wanderer went; yet Caledonia! still
  Thine was his thought in march and tented ground;
    He dreamed 'mid Alpine cliffs of Athole's hill,
And heard in Ebro's roar his Lyndoch's lovely rill.
