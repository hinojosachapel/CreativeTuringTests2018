VI.

  O triumph for the Fiends of Lust and Wrath!
    Ne'er to be told, yet ne'er to be forgot,
  What wanton horrors marked their wreckful path!
    The peasant butchered in his ruined cot,
  The hoary priest even at the altar shot,
    Childhood and age given o'er to sword and flame,
  Woman to infamy;--no crime forgot,
    By which inventive demons might proclaim
Immortal hate to man, and scorn of God's great name!
