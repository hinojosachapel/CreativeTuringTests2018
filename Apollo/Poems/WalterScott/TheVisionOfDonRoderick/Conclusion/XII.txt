XII.

  But you, ye heroes of that well-fought day,
    How shall a bard, unknowing and unknown,
  His meed to each victorious leader pay,
    Or bind on every brow the laurels won?
  Yet fain my harp would wake its boldest tone,
    O'er the wide sea to hail CADOGAN brave;
  And he, perchance, the minstrel-note might own,
    Mindful of meeting brief that Fortune gave
'Mid yon far western isles that hear the Atlantic rave.
