  Yet not because Alcoba's mountain-hawk
    Hath on his best and bravest made her food,
  In numbers confident, yon Chief shall baulk
    His Lord's imperial thirst for spoil and blood:
  For full in view the promised conquest stood,
    And Lisbon's matrons from their walls might sum
  The myriads that had half the world subdued,
    And hear the distant thunders of the drum,
That bids the bands of France to storm and havoc come.
