XV.

  Not on that bloody field of battle won,
    Though Gaul's proud legions rolled like mist away,
  Was half his self-devoted valour shown, -
    He gaged but life on that illustrious day;
  But when he toiled those squadrons to array,
    Who fought like Britons in the bloody game,
  Sharper than Polish pike or assagay,
    He braved the shafts of censure and of shame,
And, dearer far than life, he pledged a soldier's fame.
