XVII.

  O hero of a race renowned of old,
    Whose war-cry oft has waked the battle-swell,
  Since first distinguished in the onset bold,
    Wild sounding when the Roman rampart fell!
  By Wallace' side it rung the Southron's knell,
    Alderne, Kilsythe, and Tibber owned its fame,
  Tummell's rude pass can of its terrors tell,
    But ne'er from prouder field arose the name
Than when wild Ronda learned the conquering shout of GRAEME!
