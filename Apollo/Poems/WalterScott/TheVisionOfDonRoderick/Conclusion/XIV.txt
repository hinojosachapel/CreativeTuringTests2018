XIV.

  O who shall grudge him Albuera's bays,
    Who brought a race regenerate to the field,
  Roused them to emulate their fathers' praise,
    Tempered their headlong rage, their courage steeled,
  And raised fair Lusitania's fallen shield,
    And gave new edge to Lusitania's sword,
  And taught her sons forgotten arms to wield -
    Shivered my harp, and burst its every chord,
If it forget thy worth, victorious BERESFORD!
