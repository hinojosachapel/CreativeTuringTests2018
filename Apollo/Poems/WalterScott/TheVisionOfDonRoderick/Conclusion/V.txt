  Four moons have heard these thunders idly rolled,
    Have seen these wistful myriads eye their prey,
  As famished wolves survey a guarded fold -
    But in the middle path a Lion lay!
  At length they move--but not to battle-fray,
    Nor blaze yon fires where meets the manly fight;
  Beacons of infamy, they light the way
    Where cowardice and cruelty unite
To damn with double shame their ignominious flight.
