II.

  "Else ne'er to stoop, till high on Lisbon's towers
    They close their wings, the symbol of our yoke,
  And their own sea hath whelmed yon red-cross powers!"
    Thus, on the summit of Alverca's rock
  To Marshal, Duke, and Peer, Gaul's Leader spoke.
    While downward on the land his legions press,
  Before them it was rich with vine and flock,
    And smiled like Eden in her summer dress; -
Behind their wasteful march a reeking wilderness.
