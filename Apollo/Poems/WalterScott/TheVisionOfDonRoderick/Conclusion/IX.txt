IX.

  Yet, ere thou turn'st, collect each distant aid;
    Those chief that never heard the lion roar!
  Within whose souls lives not a trace portrayed
    Of Talavera or Mondego's shore!
  Marshal each band thou hast, and summon more;
    Of war's fell stratagems exhaust the whole;
  Rank upon rank, squadron on squadron pour,
    Legion on legion on thy foeman roll,
And weary out his arm--thou canst not quell his soul.
