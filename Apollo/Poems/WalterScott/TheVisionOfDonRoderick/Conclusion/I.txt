I.

  "Who shall command Estrella's mountain-tide
    Back to the source, when tempest-chafed, to hie?
  Who, when Gascogne's vexed gulf is raging wide,
    Shall hush it as a nurse her infant's cry?
  His magic power let such vain boaster try,
    And when the torrent shall his voice obey,
  And Biscay's whirlwinds list his lullaby,
    Let him stand forth and bar mine eagles' way,
And they shall heed his voice, and at his bidding stay.
