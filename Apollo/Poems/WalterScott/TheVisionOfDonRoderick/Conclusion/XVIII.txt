XVIII.

  But all too long, through seas unknown and dark,
    (With Spenser's parable I close my tale,)
  By shoal and rock hath steered my venturous bark,
    And landward now I drive before the gale.
  And now the blue and distant shore I hail,
    And nearer now I see the port expand,
  And now I gladly furl my weary sail,
    And, as the prow light touches on the strand,
I strike my red-cross flag and bind my skiff to land.
