XI.

  Go, baffled boaster! teach thy haughty mood
    To plead at thine imperious master's throne,
  Say, thou hast left his legions in their blood,
    Deceived his hopes, and frustrated thine own;
  Say, that thine utmost skill and valour shown,
    By British skill and valour were outvied;
  Last say, thy conqueror was WELLINGTON!
    And if he chafe, be his own fortune tried -
God and our cause to friend, the venture we'll abide.
