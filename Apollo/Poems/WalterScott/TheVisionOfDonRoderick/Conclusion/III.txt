  And shall the boastful Chief maintain his word,
    Though Heaven hath heard the wailings of the land,
  Though Lusitania whet her vengeful sword,
    Though Britons arm and WELLINGTON command!
  No! grim Busaco's iron ridge shall stand
    An adamantine barrier to his force;
  And from its base shall wheel his shattered band,
    As from the unshaken rock the torrent hoarse
Bears off its broken waves, and seeks a devious course.
