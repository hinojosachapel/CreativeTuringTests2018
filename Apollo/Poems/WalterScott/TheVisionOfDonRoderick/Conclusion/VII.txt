VII.

  The rudest sentinel, in Britain born,
    With horror paused to view the havoc done,
  Gave his poor crust to feed some wretch forlorn,
    Wiped his stern eye, then fiercer grasped his gun.
  Nor with less zeal shall Britain's peaceful son
    Exult the debt of sympathy to pay;
  Riches nor poverty the tax shall shun,
    Nor prince nor peer, the wealthy nor the gay,
Nor the poor peasant's mite, nor bard's more worthless lay.
