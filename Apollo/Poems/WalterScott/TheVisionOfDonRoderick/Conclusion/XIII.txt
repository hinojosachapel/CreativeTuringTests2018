  Yes! hard the task, when Britons wield the sword,
    To give each Chief and every field its fame:
  Hark! Albuera thunders BERESFORD,
    And Red Barosa shouts for dauntless GRAEME!
  O for a verse of tumult and of flame,
    Bold as the bursting of their cannon sound,
  To bid the world re-echo to their fame!
    For never, upon gory battle-ground,
With conquest's well-bought wreath were braver victors crowned!
