  O vainly gleams with steel Agueda's shore,
    Vainly thy squadrons hide Assuava's plain,
  And front the flying thunders as they roar,
    With frantic charge and tenfold odds, in vain!
  And what avails thee that, for CAMERON slain,
    Wild from his plaided ranks the yell was given -
  Vengeance and grief gave mountain-range the rein,
    And, at the bloody spear-point headlong driven,
Thy Despot's giant guards fled like the rack of heaven.
