  But we, weak minstrels of a laggard day
    Skilled but to imitate an elder page,
  Timid and raptureless, can we repay
    The debt thou claim'st in this exhausted age?
  Thou givest our lyres a theme, that might engage
    Those that could send thy name o'er sea and land,
  While sea and land shall last; for Homer's rage
    A theme; a theme for Milton's mighty hand -
How much unmeet for us, a faint degenerate band!
