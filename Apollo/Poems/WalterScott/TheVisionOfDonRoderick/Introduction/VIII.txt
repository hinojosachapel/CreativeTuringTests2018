  "Decayed our old traditionary lore,
    Save where the lingering fays renew their ring,
  By milkmaid seen beneath the hawthorn hoar,
    Or round the marge of Minchmore's haunted spring;
  Save where their legends grey-haired shepherds sing,
    That now scarce win a listening ear but thine,
  Of feuds obscure, and Border ravaging,
    And rugged deeds recount in rugged line,
Of moonlight foray made on Teviot, Tweed, or Tyne.
