  Hark, from yon misty cairn their answer tost:
    "Minstrel! the fame of whose romantic lyre,
  Capricious-swelling now, may soon be lost,
    Like the light flickering of a cottage fire;
  If to such task presumptuous thou aspire,
    Seek not from us the meed to warrior due:
  Age after age has gathered son to sire
    Since our grey cliffs the din of conflict knew,
Or, pealing through our vales, victorious bugles blew.
