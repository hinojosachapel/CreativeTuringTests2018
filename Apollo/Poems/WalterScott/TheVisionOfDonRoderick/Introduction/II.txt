II.

  Yes! such a strain, with all o'er-pouring measure,
    Might melodise with each tumultuous sound
  Each voice of fear or triumph, woe or pleasure,
    That rings Mondego's ravaged shores around;
  The thundering cry of hosts with conquest crowned,
    The female shriek, the ruined peasant's moan,
  The shout of captives from their chains unbound,
    The foiled oppressor's deep and sullen groan,
A Nation's choral hymn, for tyranny o'erthrown.
