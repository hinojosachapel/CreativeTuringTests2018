  "There, of Numantian fire a swarthy spark
    Still lightens in the sunburnt native's eye;
  The stately port, slow step, and visage dark,
    Still mark enduring pride and constancy.
  And, if the glow of feudal chivalry
    Beam not, as once, thy nobles' dearest pride,
  Iberia! oft thy crestless peasantry
    Have seen the plumed Hidalgo quit their side,
Have seen, yet dauntless stood--'gainst fortune fought and died.

  "And cherished still by that unchanging race,
    Are themes for minstrelsy more high than thine;
  Of strange tradition many a mystic trace,
    Legend and vision, prophecy and sign;
  Where wonders wild of Arabesque combine
    With Gothic imagery of darker shade,
  Forming a model meet for minstrel line.
    Go, seek such theme!"--the Mountain Spirit said.
With filial awe I heard--I heard, and I obeyed.
