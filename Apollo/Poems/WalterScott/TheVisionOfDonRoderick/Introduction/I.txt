I.

  Lives there a strain, whose sounds of mounting fire
    May rise distinguished o'er the din of war;
  Or died it with yon Master of the Lyre
    Who sung beleaguered Ilion's evil star?
  Such, WELLINGTON, might reach thee from afar,
    Wafting its descant wide o'er Ocean's range;
  Nor shouts, nor clashing arms, its mood could mar,
    All, as it swelled between each loud trumpet-change,
That clangs to Britain victory, to Portugal revenge!
