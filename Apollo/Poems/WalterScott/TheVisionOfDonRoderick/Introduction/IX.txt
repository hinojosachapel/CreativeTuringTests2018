  "No! search romantic lands, where the near Sun
    Gives with unstinted boon ethereal flame,
  Where the rude villager, his labour done,
    In verse spontaneous chants some favoured name,
  Whether Olalia's charms his tribute claim,
    Her eye of diamond, and her locks of jet;
  Or whether, kindling at the deeds of Graeme,
    He sing, to wild Morisco measure set,
Old Albin's red claymore, green Erin's bayonet!
