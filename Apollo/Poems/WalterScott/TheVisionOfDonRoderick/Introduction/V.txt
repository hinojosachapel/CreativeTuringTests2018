  Oh! if your wilds such minstrelsy retain,
    As sure your changeful gales seem oft to say,
  When sweeping wild and sinking soft again,
    Like trumpet-jubilee, or harp's wild sway;
  If ye can echo such triumphant lay,
    Then lend the note to him has loved you long!
  Who pious gathered each tradition grey
    That floats your solitary wastes along,
And with affection vain gave them new voice in song.
