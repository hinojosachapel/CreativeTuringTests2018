50

There is that in me-I do not know what it is-but I know it is in me.

Wrench'd and sweaty-calm and cool then my body becomes,
I sleep-I sleep long.

I do not know it-it is without name-it is a word unsaid,
It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.

Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,
To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.

Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters.

Do you see O my brothers and sisters?
It is not chaos or death-it is form, union, plan-it is eternal life-it is Happiness.
