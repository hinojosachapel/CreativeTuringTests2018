TO HAYDON WITH A SONNET WRITTEN ON SEEING THE ELGIN MARBLES

Haydon! Forgive me, that I cannot speak 
   Definitively on these mighty things; 
   Forgive me that I have not Eagle's wings- 
That what I want I know not where to seek: 
And think that I would not be over meek 
   In rolling out upfollow'd thunderings, 
   Even to the steep of Helciconian springs, 
Were I of ample strength for such a freak-
Think too that all those numbers should be thine; 
   Whose else? In this who touch thy vesture's hem? 
For when men star'd at what was most divine 
   With browless idiotism-o'erwise phlegm- 
Thou hadst beheld the Hesperean shine 
   Of their star in the East, and gone to worship them.
