SHUT-IN

   Across my window glass
   The moving shadows of the people pass.
   Sometimes the shadow's pause; and through the hall
   Kind neighbours come to call,
   Bringing a word or smile
   To cheer my loneliness a little while.
   But as I hear them talk,
   These people who can walk
   And go about the great green earth at will,
   I wonder if they know the joy of being still,
   And all alone with thoughts that soar afar—
   High as the highest star.
   And oft I feel more free
   Than those who travel over land and sea.
   For one who is shut in,
   Away from all the outer strife and din,
   With faithful Pain for guide,
   Finds where Great Truths abide.

   Across my window glass
   The moving shadows pass.
   But swifter moves my unimpeded thought,
   Speeding from spot to spot—
   Out and afar—
   High as the highest star.
