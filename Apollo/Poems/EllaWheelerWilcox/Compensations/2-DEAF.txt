DEAF

   I can recall a time, when on mine ears
   There fell chaotic sounds of earthly life,
   Shrill cries of triumph, and hoarse shouts of strife;
   A medley of despairs, and hopes and fears.
   Then silence came, and unavailing tears.
   The stillness stabbed me, like a two edged-knife;
   Until I found the Universe was rife
   With subtle music of the neighbouring spheres.
   Such harmonies, such congruous sweet chords,
   Wherein each note conveys a healing balm.
   And now no more I miss men's spoken words;
   For, in a quiet world of larger thought,
   I know the joy that comes from being calm.
