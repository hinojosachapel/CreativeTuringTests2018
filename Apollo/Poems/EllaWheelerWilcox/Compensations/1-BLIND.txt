BLIND

   When first the shadows fell, like prison bars,
   And darkness spread before me, like a pall,
   I cried out for the sun, the earth, the stars,
   And beat the air, as madmen beat a wall,
   Till, impotent, and broken with despair,
   I turned my vision inward.  Lo, a spark—
   A light—a torch; and all my world grew bright;
   For God's dear eyes were shining through the dark.
   Then, bringing to me gifts of recompense,
   Came keener hearing, finer taste, and touch;
   And that oft unappreciated sense,
   Which finds sweet odours, and proclaims them such;
   And not until my mortal eyes were blind
   Did I perceive how kind the world, how kind.
