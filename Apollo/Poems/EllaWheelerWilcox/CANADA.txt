      England, father and mother in one,
      Look on your stalwart son.
   Sturdy and strong, with the valour of youth,
   Where is another so lusty?
   Coated and mailed, with the armour of truth,
   Where is another so trusty?
   Flesh of your flesh, and bone of your bone,
   He is yours alone.

      England, father and mother in one,
      See the wealth of your son.
   Forests primeval, and virginal sod,
   Wheat-fields golden and splendid:
   Riches of nature and opulent God
   For the use of his children intended.
   A courage that dares, and a hope that endures,
   And a soul all yours.

      England, father and mother in one,
      Hear the cry of your son.
   Little cares he for the glories of earth
   Lying around and above him,
   Yearning is he for the rights of his birth,
   And the heart of his mother to love him.
   Vast are your gifts to him, ample his store,
   Now open your door.

      England, father and mother in one,
      Heed the voice of your son.
   Proffer him place in your councils of state:
   Let him sit near, and attend you.
   Ponder his words in the hour of debate,
   Strong is his arm to defend you.
   Flesh of your flesh, and bone of your bone,
   Give him his own.
