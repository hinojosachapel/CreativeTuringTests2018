EAST AND WEST

   The Day has never understood the Gloaming or the Night;
   Though sired by one Creative Power, and nursed at Nature's breast;
   The White Man ever fails to read the Dark Man's heart aright;
   Though from the self-same Source they came, upon the self-same quest;
   So deep and wide, the Great Divide,
   Between the East and West.

   But like a shadow on a screen, mine eyes behold, above
   The yawning gulf, a dim forecast, of structures strong and broad;
   Where caste, and colour prejudice, by countless feet down trod,
   With old traditions crushed by Time, pave smooth the bridge of Love;
   And all the creed that men shall heed
   Is consciousness of God.
