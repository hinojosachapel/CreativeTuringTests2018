REFLECTION

   Twice have I seen God's full reflected grace.
      Once when the wailing of a child at birth
      Proclaimed another soul had come to earth,
   That look shone on, and through the mother's face.

   And once when silence, absolute and vast,
      Followed the final indrawn mortal breath,
      Sudden upon the countenance of death
   That supreme glory of God's grace was cast.
