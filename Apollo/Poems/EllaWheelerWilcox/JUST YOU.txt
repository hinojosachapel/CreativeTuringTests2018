JUST YOU

   All the selfish joys of earth,
      I am getting through.
   That which used to lure and lead
      Now I pass and give no heed;
   Only one thing seems of worth—
         Just you.

   Not for me the lonely height,
      And the larger view;
   Lowlier ways seem fair and wide,
      While we wander side by side.
   One thing makes the whole world bright—
         Just you.

   Not for distant goals I run,
      No great aim pursue;
   Most of earth's ambitions seem
      Like the shadow of a dream.
   All the world to me means one—
         Just you.
