TOGETHER

   We two in the fever and fervour and glow
      Of life's high tide have rejoiced together;
   We have looked out over the glittering snow,
      And known we were dwelling in Summer weather,
   For the seasons are made by the heart I hold,
   And not by outdoor heat or cold.

   We two, in the shadows of pain and woe,
      Have journeyed together in dim, dark places,
   Where black-robed Sorrow walked to and fro,
      And Fear and Trouble, with phantom faces,
   Peered out upon us and froze our blood,
   Though June's fair roses were all in bud.

   We two have measured all depths, all heights,
      We have bathed in tears, we have sunned in laughter!
   We have known all sorrows and delights—
      They never could keep us apart hereafter.
   Whether your spirit went high or low,
   My own would follow, and find you, I know.

   If they took my soul into Paradise,
      And told me I must be content without you,
   I would weary them so with my lonesome cries,
      And the ceaseless questions I asked about you,
   They would open the gates and set me free,
   Or else they would find you and bring you to me.
