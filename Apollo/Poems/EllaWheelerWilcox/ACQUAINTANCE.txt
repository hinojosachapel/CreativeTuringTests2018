ACQUAINTANCE

   Not we who daily walk the City's street;
   Not those who have been cradled in its heart,
   Best understand its architectural art,
   Or realise its grandeur.  Oft we meet
   Some stranger who has stayed his passing feet
   And lingered with us for a single hour,
   And learned more of cathedral, and of tower,
   Than we, who deem our knowledge quite complete.

   Not always those we hold most loved and dear,
   Not always those who dwell with us, know best
   Our greater selves.  Because they stand so near
   They cannot see the lofty mountain crest,
   The gleaming sun-kissed height, which fair and dear
   Stands forth—revealed unto the some-time guest.
