PETITION

   God, may Thy loving Spirit work,
   In heart of Russian, and of Turk,
   Until throughout each clime and land,
   Armenian and Jew may stand,
   And claim the right of every soul
   To seek by its own path, the goal.
   Parts of the Universal Force,
   Rills from the same eternal Source
   Back to that Source, all races go.
   God, help Thy world to see it so.
