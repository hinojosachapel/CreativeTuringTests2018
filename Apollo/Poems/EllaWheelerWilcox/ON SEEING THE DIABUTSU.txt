ON SEEING THE DIABUTSU—AT KAMAKURA, JAPAN

   Long have I searched, cathedral shrine, and hall,
   To find a symbol, from the hand of art,
   That gave the full expression (not a part)
   Of that ecstatic peace which follows all
   Life's pain and passion.  Strange it should befall
   This outer emblem of the inner heart
   Was waiting far beyond the great world's mart—
   Immortal answer, to the mortal call.

   Unknown the artist, vaguely known his creed:
   But the bronze wonder of his work sufficed
   To lift me to the heights his faith had trod.
   For one rich moment, opulent indeed,
   I walked with Krishna, Buddha, and the Christ,
   And felt the full serenity of God.
