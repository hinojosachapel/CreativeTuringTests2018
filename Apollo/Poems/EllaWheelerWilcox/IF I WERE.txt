IF I WERE

   If I were a raindrop, and you were a leaf,
      I would burst from the cloud above you,
   And lie on your breast in a rapture of rest,
      And love you, love you, love you.

   If I were a brown bee, and you were a rose,
      I would fly to you, love, nor miss you;
   I would sip and sip from your nectared lip,
      And kiss you, kiss you, kiss you.

   If I were a doe, dear, and you were a brook,
      Ah, what would I do then, think you?
   I would kneel by the bank, in the grasses dank,
      And drink you, drink you, drink you.
