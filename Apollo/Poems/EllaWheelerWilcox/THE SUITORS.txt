THE SUITORS

   There is a little Bungalow
   Perched on a granite ledge,
   And at its feet two suitors meet;
   (I watch them, and I know)
   One waits outside the casement edge;
   One paces to and fro.

   The Patient Rock speaks not a word;
   The Sea goes up and down,
   And sings full oft, in cadence soft;
   (I listen, and have heard)
   Again he wears an angry frown
   By jealous passion stirred.

   This dawn, the Rock was all aglow;
   Far out the mad Sea went;
   Beyond the raft, like one gone daft;
   (I saw them, and I know)
   While radiant and well content
   Smiled down the Bungalow.

   That was at Dawn; ere day had set,
   The Sea with pleading voice
   Came back to woo his love anew;
   (I saw them when they met)
   And now I know not which her choice—
   (The Rock's gray face was wet.)
