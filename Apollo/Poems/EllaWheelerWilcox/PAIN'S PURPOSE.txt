PAIN'S PURPOSE

   How blind is he who prays that God will send
   All pain from earth.  Pain has its use and place;
   Its ministry of holiness and grace.
   The darker tones upon the canvas blend
   With light and colour; and their shadows lend
   The painting half its dignity.  Efface
   The sombre background, and you lose all trace
   Of that perfection which is true art's trend.

   Life is an artist seeking to reveal
   God's majesty and beauty in each soul.
   If from the palette mortal man could steal
   The precious pigment, pain, why then the scroll
   Would glare with colours meaningless and bright,
   Or show an empty canvas, blurred with light.
