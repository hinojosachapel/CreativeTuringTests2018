IV

   The summer folk, fled back to town;
   The green woods changed to red and brown;
   A sound upon the frosty air
   Of windows closing everywhere.

   And then the log, lapped by a blaze—
   Oh! what is better than these days;
   With books and friends and love a-near;
   Go on, gay world, but leave me here.
