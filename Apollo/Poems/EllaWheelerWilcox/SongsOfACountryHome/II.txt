II

   One of the sweetest hours is this;
   (Of all I think we like it best);
   A little restful oasis,
   Between the breakfast and the post.
   Just south of coffee and of toast,
   Just north of daily task and duty;
   Just west of dreams, this island gleams,
   A fertile spot of peace and beauty.

   We wander out across the lawn;
   We idle by a bush in bloom;
   The household pets come following on;
   Or if the day is one of gloom,
   We loiter in a pleasant room,
   Or from a casement lean and chatter.
   Then comes the mail, like sudden hail,
   And off we scatter.
