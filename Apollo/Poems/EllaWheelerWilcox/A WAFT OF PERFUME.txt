A WAFT OF PERFUME

   A waft of perfume from a bit of lace
      Moved lightly by a passing woman's hand;
   And on the common street, a sensuous grace
      Shone suddenly from some lost time and land.

   Tall structures changed to dome and parapet;
      The stern-faced Church an oracle became;
   In sheltered alcoves marble busts were set;
      And on the wall frail Lais wrote her name.

   Phryne before her judges stood at bay,
      Fearing the rigour of Athenian laws;
   Till Hyperides tore her cloak away,
      And bade her splendid beauty plead its cause.

   Great Alexander walking in the dusk,
      Dreamed of the hour when Greek with Greek should meet;
   From Thais' window attar breathed, and musk:
      His footsteps went no farther down the street.

   Faint and more faint the pungent perfume grew;
      Of wall and parapet remained no trace.
   Temple and statue vanished from the view:
      The city street again was commonplace.
