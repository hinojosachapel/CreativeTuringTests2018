HE FLIES, BUT PASSION PURSUES HIM

      When I reflect and turn me to that part
    Whence my sweet lady beam'd in purest light,
    And in my inmost thought remains that light
    Which burns me and consumes in every part,
    I, who yet dread lest from my heart it part
    And see at hand the end of this my light,
    Go lonely, like a man deprived of light,
    Ignorant where to go; whence to depart.
    Thus flee I from the stroke which lays me dead,
    Yet flee not with such speed but that desire
    Follows, companion of my flight alone.
    Silent I go:--but these my words, though dead,
    Others would cause to weep--this I desire,
    That I may weep and waste myself alone.
