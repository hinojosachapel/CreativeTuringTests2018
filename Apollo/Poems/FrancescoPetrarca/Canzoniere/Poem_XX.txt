THE PRAISES OF LAURA TRANSCEND HIS POETIC POWERS

      Ashamed sometimes thy beauties should remain
    As yet unsung, sweet lady, in my rhyme;
    When first I saw thee I recall the time,
    Pleasing as none shall ever please again.
    But no fit polish can my verse attain,
    Not mine is strength to try the task sublime:
    My genius, measuring its power to climb,
    From such attempt doth prudently refrain.
    Full oft I oped my lips to chant thy name;
    Then in mid utterance the lay was lost:
    But say what muse can dare so bold a flight?
    Full oft I strove in measure to indite;
    But ah, the pen, the hand, the vein I boast,
    At once were vanquish'd by the mighty theme!
