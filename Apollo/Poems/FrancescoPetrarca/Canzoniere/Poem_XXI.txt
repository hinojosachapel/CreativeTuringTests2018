HIS HEART, REJECTED BY LAURA, WILL PERISH, UNLESS SHE RELENT

      A thousand times, sweet warrior, have I tried,
    Proffering my heart to thee, some peace to gain
    From those bright eyes, but still, alas! in vain,
    To such low level stoops not thy chaste pride.
    If others seek the love thus thrown aside,
    Vain were their hopes and labours to obtain;
    The heart thou spurnest I alike disdain,
    To thee displeasing, it is by me denied.
    But if, discarded thus, it find not thee
    Its joyless exile willing to befriend,
    Alone, untaught at others' will to wend,
    Soon from life's weary burden will it flee.
    How heavy then the guilt to both, but more
    To thee, for thee it did the most adore.
