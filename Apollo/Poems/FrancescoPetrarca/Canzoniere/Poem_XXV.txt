HE CONGRATULATES BOCCACCIO ON HIS RETURN TO THE RIGHT PATH

      Love grieved, and I with him at times, to see
    By what strange practices and cunning art,
    You still continued from his fetters free,
    From whom my feet were never far apart.
    Since to the right way brought by God's decree,
    Lifting my hands to heaven with pious heart,
    I thank Him for his love and grace, for He
    The soul-prayer of the just will never thwart:
    And if, returning to the amorous strife,
    Its fair desire to teach us to deny,
    Hollows and hillocks in thy path abound,
    It is but to prove to us with thorns how rife
    The narrow way, the ascent how hard and high,
    Where with true virtue man at last is crown'd.
